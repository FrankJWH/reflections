This is my final file for git.
I'm practicing how to create branches and merge and reset stuff.
First I will add this line and delete it.
Another line

git merge <branch> for merge specified <branch> into current branch

git branch -d <branch> to delete branch after changes have been commited

git branch -dr origin/<branch> to delete branch & remote branch on github

git push origin  --delete <remote-branch> to only delete remote github branch 

git push -u origin master  to make your first commit to your new repository

git rm --cached <filename> to remove the file from git push for gitignore (opposite of git add)

git rm -r --cached . to remove all these files from the stage, below is safer, research git head and path

git reset (<file>) to unstage file, or leave out file to unstage all

git reset --hard <commit> to reset back to commit permanently

git checkout -- <file> to remove a file being asked to be "git add ."

git commit --amend to add another file or change to the last commit

git remote -v   to see current remotes and their links

git remote add upstream <remote-URL> to add another remote repo to pull/push from ("upstream" is usually the original parent repo fork)

git remote set-url <remote-name> <URL> to redirect remote's current link to a new link

Thanks!
