This is my final file for git.
I'm practicing how to create branches and merge and reset stuff.
First I will add this line and delete it.
Another line

This link has commonly used git commands: https://github.com/joshnh/Git-Commands

git add -p <file>: this will allow you to add specific lines to stage instead of the entire file

git merge <branch> for merge specified <branch> into current branch

git branch -d <branch> to delete branch after changes have been commited

git branch -dr origin/<branch> to delete branch & remote branch on github

git branch -a to show all the branches including the hidden branches you never worked with

git push origin  --delete <remote-branch> to only delete remote github branch 

git push -u origin master  to make your first commit to your new repository

git pull -r [<remote-name>, <branch-name>]: pull all the changes from the git remote without any merges, will place your commits after the new remote commits, DANGEROUS

git pull <remote-name> <remote-branch-to-pull-from:branch-to-get-pull>: this provides the branch that you want updates from and apply it to the branch that you want the commit updates. Normally to keep a new branch updated for a PR

git diff <local-branch-name> <remote/local-branch-name> to see what the remote has changed vs your local

git fetch to update current branch's remote

git fetch --dry-run: see what will happen when you run a pull

git rm --cached <filename> to remove the file from git push for gitignore (opposite of git add)

git rm -r --cached . to remove all these files from the stage, below is safer, research git head and path

git reset (<file>) to unstage file, or leave out file to unstage all

git reset --hard <commit> to reset back to commit permanently

git checkout -- <file> to remove a file being asked to be "git add ."

git commit --amend to add another file or change to the last commit

git remote -v   to see current remotes and their links

git remote add upstream <remote-URL> to add another remote repo to pull/push from ("upstream" is usually the original parent repo fork)

git remote set-url <remote-name> <URL> to redirect remote's current link to a new link

git remote update to update all the branches on that remote (i.e. origin will update all branches)

Thanks!
