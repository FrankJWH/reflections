This is my final file for git.
I'm practicing how to create branches and merge and reset stuff.
First I will add this line and delete it.
Another line

git merge <branch> for merge specified <branch> into current branch

git branch -d <branch> to delete branch after changes have been commited

git branch -dr origin/<branch> to delete branch & remote branch on github

git push origin  --delete <remote-branch> to only delete remote github branch 

git reset (<file>) to unstage file, or leave out file to unstage all

git reset --hard <commit> to reset back to commit permanently
