This will remind you how to undo make, make install, autogen, and ./configure
These may not work but mostly likely will and must be run within the file

make, make install
	make clean
	make uninstall

autogen.sh, ./configure
	make clean
	make distclean

others include....

make mostlyclean
make clean
make distclean
make maintainer-clean
